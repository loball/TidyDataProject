This document is a readme file which explains everything needed to execute 
like this:

```{r}
The only file to be executed is the run_analysis.R r file.  It should be 
placed in your working directory.  All other files downloaded and created
will be based off your working directory.

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
